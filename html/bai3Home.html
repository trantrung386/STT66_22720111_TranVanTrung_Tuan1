    <p> <span style="color: red;"> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off.
         I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
    <p>I've started putting up a <span style="color: blue;">slide show</span> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. 
        If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>

    <p>Once <again:span style="color: red;">BRAVO!!!</again:span>  -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
